\section*{Introduction}

Marine wild capture fisheries provide more than 80 million tons of
fisheries products (both food and industrial) per year and employ 43.5
million people (wild capture and aquaculture, \citep{FAO:sofia}).
At the same time, fishing has been recognized as having one of the
most widespread human impacts in the world's oceans
\citep{Halpern:etal:2008:science}, and the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that two-thirds of
fish stocks globally are fully exploited or overexploited
\citep{FAO:sofia}.  While many fisheries have reduced exploitation
rates to levels that should in theory promote recovery, overfishing continues to
be a serious global problem \citep{Worm:etal:2009:science}.  Fishery
managers are asked to address multiple competing objectives, including
maximizing yields, ensuring profitability, reducing bycatch, and
minimizing the risk of overfishing.  Given the enormous social and
economic costs \citep{Rice:etal:2003:icescm} and ecosystems
consequences \citep{Frank:etal:2005:science, Myers:etal:2007:science}
of collapsed fisheries, it is imperative that we are able to quickly
learn from successful and failed fisheries from around the world.

Effective management of exploited fish populations generally requires
an understanding of where the current size and harvest rate
lie in relation to the size and rate which maximize
fishery benefits or limit the risk of overfishing.  This process of
quantitative determination of stock status and estimation of reference
points is called stock assessment.  Some fisheries in developing
countries have apparently provided sustainable yields for long periods
of time without formal stock assessment (e.g. many community-managed
fisheries in Oceania, \citep{Johannes:2002:arees}).  This has been achieved by
limiting harvest rates, often through gear restrictions or seasonal or
area closures.  In modern industrialized fisheries, however, where fishing
capacity exceeds the productivity of fished stocks stock
assessment is an integral component of responsible
management \citep{Hilborn:Walters:1992}.

The global databases of fishery landings compiled by FAO
\citep{FAO:fishstat} and synthesized by the Sea Around Us project
\citep{Watson:etal:2004:fandf} have proven to be valuable resources
for understanding the status of fisheries worldwide; however, catch
data alone can be misleading when used as a proxy for stock size.
Many papers have used these data to examine changes in fishery status
\citep{Worm:etal:2006:science, Costello:etal:2008:science}, including
changes in trophic level \citep{Pauly:etal:1998,
  Essington:etal:2006:procnatacadsci, Newton:etal:2007:currentbiol}.
Most of these analyses rely (either explicitly or implicitly) on the
assumption that catch or landings is a reliable index of stock size.
Critics have pointed out that catch can change for a number of reasons
unrelated to stock size, including changes in targeting, fishing
restrictions, or market preferences \citep{deMutsert:etal:2008:pnas,
  Murawski:Methot:Tromble:2007:science, Hilborn:2007:science}.
Standardizing catch by the amount of fishing effort
(catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE) is an improvement, particularly when
these data are modeled to account for spatial, temporal, and
operational factors affecting the CPUE, but CPUE can still be an
unreliable index of relative abundance since it is difficult to
account for all relevant factors \citep{Hutchings:Myers:1994:cjfas,
  Harley:etal:2001:cjfas, Walters:2003:cjfas, Polacheck:2006:marpol}.

Stock assessments consider time series of catch along with other
sources of information such as: natural mortality rates, changes in
size or age composition, stock-recruitment relationships, and CPUE
coming from different fisheries and/or from fishery-independent surveys.
Because they integrate across multiple sources of information, stock
assessment models are thought to provide a more accurate picture of
changes in abundance than catch data alone
\citep{Sibert:etal:2006:science}. Yet, without a current and
comprehensive database of stock assessments, scientists wishing to
conduct comparative analyses of marine fish population dynamics and
fishery status have little choice but to use problematic catch data.

The first global database of stock assessment information, the Myers
Stock Recruitment Database, was developed by the late Ransom A. Myers
and colleagues in the mid-1990s \citep{Myers:etal:1995:summary}.
While the database was primarily known for its time series of stock
and recruitment, it did contain time series of fishing mortality rates
for many stocks; biological reference points were however largely
absent. The original release version of the Myers database
\citep{Myers:etal:1995:summary} included spawning stock size and
recruitment time series for 274 stocks representing 92 species as well
as fishing mortality rates time series for 144 stocks. The number of
entered stocks grew to approximately 642 stocks (509 with at least one
SR pair) over the period from 1995-2005. Note that the Salmonidae
comprised 290 assessments in the original database.  The assessment
results collated by Dr. Myers were used to:
\begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)] \item decisively answer the question of
  whether recruitment shows any relationship to spawning stock size
  \citep{Myers:Barrowman:1996:fishbull}, \item investigate potential
  depensation in stock-recruitment relationships
  \citep{Myers:etal:1995:science, Liermann:Hilborn:1997:cjfas,
    Garvey:etal:2009:cjfas}, \item discover generalities in the annual
  reproductive rates of fishes \citep{Myers:etal:1999:cjfas,
    Myers:etal:2001:cjfas}, \item investigate density-dependence in
  juvenile mortality \citep{Myers:2001:ices, Minto:etal:2008:nature}, \item develop informative Bayesian priors on steepness
  \citep{Myers:etal:1999:cjfas, Myers:etal:2002:najfm,
    Dorn:2002:najfm}, and \item examine patterns of collapse and recovery in exploited fish populations \citep{Hilborn:1997:csiro, Hutchings:2000:nature, Hutchings:2001:jfishb, Hutchings:Baum:2005:philB} \end{inparaenum}.  

%The Myers database has also
%been used for several studies of collapse and recovery of exploited
%fish populations \citep{Hutchings:2000:nature, Hutchings:2001:jfishb,
%  Hilborn:1997:csiro}..

Although the original Myers database \citep{Myers:etal:1995:summary}
was critical for motivating comparative analyses in fisheries science, most of the stocks are now 15 years out of date.
For stocks that were depleted in 1995, the past 15 years
include valuable observations at low stock size or of a recovering
population, both of which are critical for estimating population
dynamics parameters such as the behaviour of the stock-recruitment
relationship near the origin. In addition, there have been numerous improvements in
stock assessment methodologies (including important advances in
statistical catch-at-age or catch-at-length models) and assessments
have been conducted for the first time for many species.

Meta-analyses of fishery status also have been hampered by the
lack of a global assessment database containing biological reference
points (BRPs, e.g., the total/spawning biomass and fishing mortality rate that
produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), $B_{MSY}$ and $F_{MSY}$).  Knowledge of BRPs
is important if stocks are to be managed for high yields that can be
sustained over time \citep{Mace:1994:cjfas}.  Without information on
reference points, previous analyses of stock assessments or catch data
have been forced to use non-biological thresholds to define fishery
status, such as the greatest 15-year decline
\citep{Hutchings:Reynolds:2004:biosci} or 10 percent of maximum catch
\citep{Worm:etal:2006:science}. Ad hoc reference points based on some
fraction of the maximum of a time series also have undesirable
statistical properties and can result in false collapses when applied
to inherently variable time series of catch or abundance
\citep{Wilberg:Miller:2007:science, branch:2008:marpol}.  Complicating
comparisons of fishery status is the fact that different BRPs are used
in different parts of the world and even the same BRP can be used in a
different manner, for example, as a target or as a limit. 

Here we present a new global database of stock assessments for
commercially exploited marine fish populations.  The database is an
update and extension of that developed by Ransom A. Myers, and is named
the RAM Legacy database in honour of his pioneering contribution.  This
effort is the first global stock assessment database to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a formal relational database structure;
\item Use source control software to organise release versions;
\item Include metadata related to the geographic location of the stock, the type of assessment model used, and the original source document for the assessment data;
\item Include biological reference points, in addition to stock-specific life history information. 
\end{enumerate}


We use the new RAM Legacy database (Version 1.0, 2010) to evaluate the
knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine populations in terms
of institutional contributions, geography, taxonomy, ecology,
timespan, stock assessment methodologies and BRPs. We compare the
database's taxonomic coverage to that of global fisheries catches and to
global fish diversity. We then evaluate the status of assessed stocks
globally, and by management body, referencing all stocks to a
comparable benchmark. Finally, we discuss biases in the knowledge base
for assessed marine species, highlight potential applications of the
database, point out its caveats and limitations, and outline
directions for future development.

\section*{Methods} 

\subsection*{The RAM Legacy database}
The RAM Legacy database is a global relational database designed and
developed to store data from all current and accessible population
dynamics model-based fisheries stock assessments for marine fish and
invertebrate populations. Time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB),
total biomass (TB), recruits (R), total catch (TC) or landings (TL),
and fishing mortality (F) from individual stock assessments form the
core of the database.  Apart from catch/landings, these time series
are not raw data, but rather the output of population dynamics models;
depending on the type of assessment model not all of these time series
were available for every stock. The database also contains details
about the time series data, including the age and sex of spawners, age
of recruits, and the ages used to compute the fishing mortality, as
well as BRPs and some life history information (e.g. growth
parameters, age and length at 50\% maturity, natural mortality).
Metadata for each stock assessment consists of taxonomic information
about the species and the geographic location of the stock (detailed in
``Links to related databases''), the management body that conducted
the assessment, the assessment methodology, the reference for the
stock assessment document, the name of the recorder entering the
assessment data, and the date the assessment was entered.  Some
assessments, particularly those for invertebrates, were based only on
CPUE time series rather than population dynamics models. While we
included these in the database (n=26), the database description and
analyses presented here focus on those stocks assessed using
population dynamics models.

Over the past two and a half years, we have employed a variety of
search methods in an attempt to obtain all recent fisheries stock
assessments.  Publicly available stock assessment reports available
from the internet were the primary data source.  These reports were
obtained either from the website of the relevant management agency or
directly from stock assessment scientists.  Other assessments were
obtained from the primary literature and through personal contacts at
fisheries management agencies.  Significant contributions were also
made by the other members of the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group ``Finding common ground
in marine conservation and management''. Relevant assessment data were
first transferred into a standardized spreadsheet template by a number
of recorders, including ourselves, assessment authors, our NCEAS
collaborators, and associated graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, and then uploaded into the relational database management
system by the first author.

\subsection*{Database structure and advantages}
The database is implemented in the Open Source PostgreSQL relational
database management system (RDBMS) \citep{postgresql:2009}, and includes tables for the assessment metadata,
time series values, time series units, and biometrics (a catch-all term
for data, such as life history characteristics or BRPs, that are not
part of a time series). The entity relationship diagram of the database and its component tables can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
%tables is shown in the  (Figure~\ref{fig:ERD}).

RDBMSs form the server back-end to many applications of
interest to ecologists, including web-clients and GIS software, and
have a number of advantages over spreadsheet or flat text file data
compilations.  First, housing stock assessments in an RDBMS allows
multiple users to concurrently access and extract subsets of data in
an efficient and reproducible manner. Second, with the development of
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow analytical
softwares to directly communicate and extract data from the database,
a common data environment is established, independent of one's choice
of analytical software (e.g., SAS:SAS ACCESS, Matlab: Matlab/Database,
R:RDBI/RODBC, Perl:DBI, etc.).  Users familiar with Structured Query
Language (SQL) can also query the database directly from their
analytical software of choice and the same SQL query will extract the
same data through each of these applications.  Third, data products
tailored to specific projects can be generated and stored as dynamic
(i.e. continually updated) ``views'' within the database.  These are
typically rectangular, spreadsheet-like results of an expansive query
of the relevant tables that can be readily read into all commonly-used
analytical software.  The use of views is advantageous over
manipulating spreadsheets or flat text files for importing into a
specific analytic software, which runs the risk of losing data
integrity (e.g. multiple copies) and becomes impractical with large,
non-rectangular datasets and multiple users.

\subsection*{Data integrity and quality control}
We have employed several mechanisms to ensure that the database is of
high quality. During the data recording process, assessment authors
often were contacted to clarify aspects of the assessment or to obtain
more detailed data. Time series data presented only in assessment
report figures were, for example, only entered into the database if
the exact numbers could be obtained from the assessment or its
authors. In cases where multiple models were presented in an
assessment without a preferred or ~best~ model being denoted, we
attempted to ascertain which model was preferred by the stock
assessment scientist, but included all model results whenever this was
not possible.  Once uploaded into the database all stock assessments
underwent an additional ~Quality Assurance/Quality Control~ (QA/QC)
step, to ensure that the entered data replicated that of the original
assessment document exactly. This process consisted of creating a
QA/QC summary document for each assessment, containing summary details
of the stock, a selection of biometrics and ratios for comparison
(e.g. current status relative to BRP), and time series plots of the
biomass, recruitment, and exploitation trajectories. QA/QC documents
were then returned to assessment recorders and an electronic trail of
subsequent correspondence was captured using a bug tracking system.
Recorders were responsible for checking, and where necessary
correcting, their QA/QC documents, after which all corrections were
transmitted back to the operational database and a quality controlled
flag was inserted to signify the assessment had passed the check. Only
assessments that have passed this QA/QC step are available for
subsequent analyses.

% The only exception to this is Indian Ocean bigeye tuna, a
%stock assessed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) for which we
%could not obtain the model output from the assessment authors.

\subsection*{Links to related databases}


To facilitate integration of the RAM Legacy database with related
databases, such as Fishbase \citep{Froese:Pauly:2009:fishbase} and the
Sea Around Us Project's (SAUP) global landings database
\citep{Watson:etal:2004:fandf}, each species present in the RAM Legacy
database was assigned a matching FishBase species name and species
code, a matching SAUP taxon code, and taxonomic information from the
Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) (http://www.itis.gov).
Additionally, each stock was assigned to a primary (and in some cases
secondary and tertiary) Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)
\citep{NOAA:LME64:1998}.  LMEs encompass the continental shelves of
the world's oceans and represent the most productive areas of the
oceans.  Open ocean areas beyond the continental shelves are, however,
not included in the LME classification. Large, highly migratory
oceanic species such as tuna were therefore assigned to new categories
``Atlantic High Seas'', ``Pacific High Seas'', ``Indian High Seas'',
and ``Subantarctic High Seas''.

\subsection*{Assessing the knowledge-base for commercially exploited stocks}
We assess the knowledge-base for commercially exploited stocks, as
represented by the RAM Legacy database, using a variety of metrics. To
evaluate the taxonomic scope of the database, we compare the taxonomy
of assessed stocks with the diversity of i) all marine fishes (as
represented by FishBase), and ii) marine fishes in global fisheries
catches (as represented by the species available from the SAUP
database), and discuss taxonomic biases in species included in catch
data and in populations assessed using stock assessments. We evaluate
the ecological scope of assessed stocks in terms of age at sexual
maturity as reported in the assessments, and trophic level of those
assessed stocks as reported in FishBase. We overview the types of
assessment models used, and BRPs estimated, for all stock assessments
and by management body. To determine what fraction of world
wild-capture fisheries landings come from assessed stocks, we used the
SAUP's average global fisheries catches from the most recent ten years
of available data (1995-2004); we also discuss limitations to
obtaining assessments for some of the world's major fisheries.
Comparisons between assessments and catch data at a regional level are
hampered by the geographic mismatch between stocks and FAO statistical
areas or the SAUP's Large Marine Ecosystems.

%; we
%also evaluate how the frequencies of different assessment model types
%and BRPs has changed over time

%Next, we briefly overview the types of asssessment models and BRPs
%contained within the stock assessments, and the frequencies of
%different assessment methods and BRPs overall and by management body.

\subsection*{Assessing the status of commercially exploited marine stocks}
We evaluate the status of assessed stocks overall and by management
body, using standard reference points so that all
stocks are referenced to a comparable benchmark.  Following
\cite{Froese:Proelss:2010:fandf} and \cite{Worm:etal:2009:science}, we
compare the current biomass and exploitation rate of stocks relative
to their MSY reference points, $B_{MSY}$ and $U_{MSY}$, respectively. 

We do not advocate the use of MSY targets for management, but still
report MSY-related BRPs because they are the most commonly estimated
BRP and can be used to compare multiple stocks.  For those assessments
that did not contain MSY reference points, but did include total catch
($TC_{i,s}$, $i \in {1,\ldots,n_{s}}$) and total biomass ($TB_{i,s}$,
$i \in {1,\ldots,n_{s}}$) time series data, we used a Schaefer surplus
production model to estimate total biomass and exploitation rate at
MSY ($TB_{MSY_{s}}$ and $u_{MSY}$, respectively). Surplus production
of stock $s$ in year $t$, $P_{s,t}$, is a commonly used measure of
stock productivity, representing the amount of catch that can be taken
while maintaining the biomass at a constant size, and can be
calculated as:

\begin{equation}
P_{s,t}  = TB_{s,t+1} - TB_{s,t} + TC_{s,t}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{description}
\item $TB_{s,t}$ is the total biomass of stock $s$ in year $t$
\item $TC_{s,t}$ is the total catch of stock $s$ in year $t$
\end{description}

We fit a Schaefer surplus-production model, which is based on a logistic model of population
growth to the catch and total biomass time series data. The predicted surplus production in each
year in the Schaefer model is given by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{P_{s,t}} = \frac{4mTB_{s,t}}{K} - 4m\left(\frac{TB_{s,t}}{K} \right)^{2}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{description}
\item $m$ is the maximum sustainable yield, equal to $rK/4$
\item $K$ is the carrying capacity or equilibrium total biomass in the absence of fishing \citep{Hilborn:Walters:1992}
\end{description}

We estimated the model parameters ($m$ and $K$) using maximum
likelihood in AD Model Builder \citep{admb} assuming that the
residuals $\epsilon_{s,t}=P_{s,t} - \hat{P_{s,t}}$ were normally
distributed.  For the Schaefer model, $B_{MSY}$ is simply $0.5K$, and the
harvest rate that results in maximum sustainable yield, $u_{MSY}$, is
$m/B_{MSY}$. Carrying capacity was constrained to be less than twice the
maximum observed total biomass.


% for the stock (s) as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%TB_{i+1,s} = TB_{i,s}*\left(1+\frac{r_{s}}{K_{s}}\right) - TC_{i,s}
%\end{equation}
%where,
%\begin{description}
%\item $r_{s}$ is the intrinsic growth rate of stock $s$
%\item $K_{s}$ is the carrying capacity of stock $s$
%\end{description}

%BRPs are obtained from: 
%\begin{equation}
%TB_{MSY_{s}} = K_{s}/2 % \left( 1 - \frac{}{r_{s}}\right)
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%MSY_{s} = r_{s}K_{s}/4
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%U_{MSY_{s}} = MSY_{s}/TB_{MSY_{s}}
%\end{equation}
%\citep{Quinn:Deriso:1999}.



%For assessments where both a biomass-based and an
%exploitation-based reference point are available, we calculate the ratio of the
%current biomass and fishing mortality to its corresponding BRP.

%We also evaluate how stock status relates to a species trophic level (obtained from FishBase).

Finally, we discuss potential applications of the database, point out
its limitations and caveats about its use, and outline directions for
future development.

Statistical analyses and plot generation were conducted with the R

\section*{Discussion}
\subsection*{The knowledge-base and status of commercially exploited marine stocks}
The RAM Legacy Database provides detailed time series and point data
from available stock assessments for the world's industrial marine
fisheries, thus providing a basis for evaluating the existing
knowledge-base and current status of these fisheries. Accessible stock
assessments are predominantly from developed nations in
north-temperate regions, and tend to cover only the past few decades,
typically a significantly shorter period than that for which the stock
has been exploited. The taxonomic makeup of available assessments is a
very limited subset of the accepted taxonomic coverage of marine
species worldwide, and of globally exploited species. Most notably
(with the exception of tunas), assessment-based knowledge is not
available for coral reef and other tropical fishes. Inshore (e.g.
estuarine species) and anadramous populations are also noteworthy in
their absence (as a result of our focus on federally or
internationally managed marine species) and, as such, any assessment
of global status of exploited populations must be interpreted only for
that subset of exploited species for which assessments are present in
the database.
% [need to briefly discuss the ‘Stock Status’ results]


Note that BRPs derived from surplus production models are to be
interpreted with great care. For stocks where both were avaialble, we
compared the values of assessment BRPs and Schaefer-derived BRPs
(Figure S2) and found correlations of XX\% between $B_{msy}$ BRPs and
XX\% between $U_{msy}$ BRPs.


\subsection*{Biases in the knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine stocks}

\subsubsection*{Geographic bias}
Bias in the geographic scope of the RAM Legacy database (relative to
that of all fisheries globally) may arise for several reasons, all of
which vary geographically in their prevalence: 1. an assessment is not
conducted on a stock; 2. it is not possible to access the assessment;
or 3. the non-exhaustive collation we undertook overlooked the
assessment. Whether an assessment is conducted for a given stock
depends upon a multitude of factors, including the economic value of
the stock, the availability of fiscal resources to collect the data
required for an assessment (which frequently includes conducting
fisheries-independent research surveys) and the expertise to conduct
assessments. In general, conducting stock assessments is a costly
endeavour that is restricted to wealthy fishing nations. The legal
context where fisheries are prosecuted can also strongly influence the
requirement for conducting stock assessments. In the United States,
the Magnuson-Stevens Act defines which stocks are to be monitored and
managed, hence a large number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy
database are under the jurisdiction of the US National Marine
Fisheries Services. How accessible assessments are for entry depends
upon the transparency and access policies of the relevant management
agencies, which also varies geographically. Our incomplete search for
assessments could also give rise to geographic biases, as concerted
collation efforts have only been conducted in those known
assessment-rich regions.  It is hoped that readers of this article can
assist in correcting these biases by participating in future updates
of the RAM Legacy database, and that the development of this database
will encourage greater transparency amongst fishing nations.


\subsubsection*{Taxonomic bias}
Related to geographic bias is the taxonomic bias in those species that
are known, caught and assessed. At a broad level the Gadiformes and
Clupeiformes occupy disproportionate taxonomic representation in the
catch compared to overall species occurrence (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}, panels a and
b). Taxonomic biases at this level may reflect behavioural tendencies
of the over-represented species in the catch to form large aggregated
populations in temperate regions that are readily accessible to
fishing. Consumer preferences may also be an important determinant of
what taxonomic groups are more likely to be caught.  The
over-representation of the Gadiformes and, to a lesser degree, the
Clupeiformes, continues when caught and assessed taxa are compared
(Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}, panels b and c). Historical economic importance as well as
the geographic distribution of the taxa in relation to mandated
assessments may play important roles in determining what fished taxa
are assessed.  Even in developed countries, however, not all stocks
are assessed. For example, in 2007, of the 528 fish and invertebrate
stocks recognized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
only 179, or slightly over one-third, were fully assessed \citep{NMFS:2008:status}. An assessment by the European
Environment Agency (EEA) in 2006 indicated that the percentage of
commercial landings obtained from assessed stocks ranged between 66-97
percent in northern European waters and 30-77 percent in the
Mediterranean \citep{eea:2009:status}. The New Zealand
Ministry of Fisheries reports the status of 117 stocks or sub-stocks
out of a total of 628 stocks managed under New Zealand's Quota
Management System \citep{NZMF:2009}. In
Australia, 98 federally managed stocks have been assessed
\citep{Wilson:etal:2009:status} out of an unknown total. The extent to
which stocks are assessed elsewhere in the world is currently unknown.

\subsubsection*{Temporal bias}
Most of the assessments in the RAM Legacy database contain time series
of 30 years or less whereas industrial fishing began long before this.
Dominant age-structured assessment methodologies typically rely on
catch-at-age data, which are often available for considerably shorter
periods of time than total catch unless significant reconstruction
efforts are made.  Such historical reconstructions of catch-at-age
data are highly uncertain and in many cases the ``base case'' models
used for management are based only on more reliable recent catch data.
For assessments used in a tactical sense and for short-term
projection, e.g., to understand whether a particular quota level will
result in an increase or decrease in stock size, using only reliable
recent catch data may be preferable.  This is particularly true for
backward projection methods (e.g., VPA), which may converge on
parameter estimates within the more reliable recent period and
potentially benefit little from reaching further back in time.
Nevertheless, a focus on only the recent history of a fishery can be
seriously misleading for strategic decisions about goals and BRPs.
Put simply, if we don't know what's historically possible (in terms of
stock size), it's hard to know where we should set our goals.  This
``shifting baseline'' problem has been widely recognized
\citep{Pauly:1995:tree, SaenzArroyo:etal::2005:procB}, but is still apparent in the
relatively short time series of most assessments.

\subsubsection*{Future applications of the RAM Legacy database}
We anticipate that this new database will be of utility for fisheries
scientists, ecologists, and marine conservation biologists interested
in conducting comparative analyses of global fisheries status,
collapse and recovery patterns, fisheries productivity or marine
population dynamics. In addition to the initial aim of providing
reliable access to time series information about stocks, we hope to
also stimulate research in the relationships of life-history
characteristics and their relation to exploitation. The RAM Legacy
database contains the corresponding species codes to the Sea Around Us
Project and FishBase, thus facilitating researchers' use of a global
fisheries data ``toolkit'' to address questions on the relationships
between life history attributes and resulting population dynamics in
an exploited setting.

\subsubsection*{Caveats and limitations}
Stock assessment outputs (e.g. biomass time series), which comprise the
majority of the new RAM Legacy database are model estimates, not raw
data. The uncertainty associated with these estimates should be
carried forth in subsequent analyses. Although the database structure
allows for inclusion of estimates of uncertainty (standard errors,
95\% credible/confidence intervals), because these estimates were
typically missing from assessments, either because they weren’t
produced by the assessment model (e.g. non-bootstrapped VPA
assessments) or the focus of the assessment document was on central
tendency (e.g. mean biomass) not the associated uncertainty, they have
not been included in this first version of the database. Note that
this view of assessment uncertainty is changing with the advent of
MCMC approaches to Bayesian inference for assessments, bootstrap
methods, statistical catch-at-age models \citep{admb} and a
general focus on uncertainty \citep{Walters:Maguire:1996:reviews}. As with any
analysis, clearer inference on the strength of a signal is available
when all uncertainty in the data is carried forth. This represents a
difficulty for synthetic analyses of fisheries data in that in an
ideal world one would access the raw data for each stock and carry
forth the uncertainty at all levels of the analysis. In the case of
assessments, the raw data is typically catch-at-age matrices and
potentially survey indices. To understand the fleet characteristics
and survey stratification schema for each stock in a potentially
global meta-analysis would be extremely time consuming and
error-prone. Instead, the expert opinion of those researchers most
familiar with the data, stock assessment authors, is used, while
recognizing that without accompanying uncertainty estimates the
strength of conclusions drawn may be weakened.  

The original database developed by Ransom A. Myers was used to address
a variety of ecological questions derived from stock-recruit
relationships. This was possible because the VPA-type assessment
models that comprised most of that database generated time series of
stock and recruitment with relatively few a priori assumptions.
Forward projection methods generally specify the form of the
stock-recruit relationship, and in many cases even fix parameters
(infinitely dense point prior) such as steepness.  Stock-recruitment
``data'' from such models, are clearly inappropriate for
straightforward meta-analysis.

More generally, meta-analysis may become the victim of its own
success.  As more assessments incorporate some type of prior
information from other stocks or species
\citep{Hilborn:Liermann:1998:reviews}, there is less stock-specific
information available for future meta-analysis.  One solution is for
stock assessments to report not only best estimates of parameters
based on all available data, but also stock-specific parameter
estimates that do not incorporate prior information from other stocks
or species.  Similarly, state-space models represent a significant
advance over observation error models.  Yet, variability in
state-space model outputs such as biomass time series often reflects
assumptions about the relative contributions of process and
observation error.

\subsubsection*{Future development}

We anticipate that the RAM Legacy database will continue to grow with
hitherto unentered stocks e.g. freshwater and anadramous populations,
particularly the Salmonidae that comprised 45\% of the stocks in the
original Myers Stock Recruitment Database, and updated assessments for
already included stocks. Future versions of the database will also
include timelines of management actions per stock, as well as
age-varying and length-varying data such as maturity ogives and
age-disaggregated natural mortality. Depending on availability,
subsequent releases of the database could also include estimates of
assessment uncertainty. Future database products will include
management-agency-level reports containing summaries of all stocks
within their remit.  The development of a standard for assessment
reporting at the management agency level would greatly assist in the
acquisition of new assessments, and hence to ensure that the database
remains current.  For example, ICES assessments have a very regular
standard, including agreed-upon reference points and regular estimate
reporting. This makes the process of data collation much more routine
than unstandardized documents where the recorder trawls through a
report for the relevant information. ICES also has a central database
of assessments for stocks of the region. Certainly different stocks
and regions require different formats but basic output tables,
consisting of total and spawning biomass, recruitment, catch/landings,
estimated fishing mortality over vulnerable age groups, associated
measures of uncertainty, and commonly-used reference points would
streamline the process immensely. A process whereby the assessment
spreadsheets are filled out at each assessment meeting would
facilitate the process even further and be the least error prone
method. In return, the assessment scientists can access results for a
global collation of assessments to further their own research
initiatives in population assessment and management. The ultimate goal
is to provide a comprehensive stock assessment database for
researchers to use results from multiple regions to assist in their
own applied and fundamental research in population ecology, fisheries
science, and conservation biology.
